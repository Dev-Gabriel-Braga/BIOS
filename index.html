  BIOS (acronym for Biologically Inspired Optimization System) is an academic software for 
  the optimization for black-box functions. BIOS focuses on structural problems, and has
  dedicated classes which assist in the optimization of laminated and Functionally Graded
  composites. Also, BIOS is capable of handling Surrogate-Based Optimization, performing
  adaptive sampling via Bayesian Optimization methods, such as the Expected Improvement or
  the Lower Confidence Bound.
